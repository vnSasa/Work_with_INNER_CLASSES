# Work_with_INNER_CLASSES

Create an Iterator interface in which to declare the method hasNext(), next().

Create a Collection class in which to declare an array field of type Number.

Create a constructor with certain parameters where to pass this array.

- Create two inner classes that will implement the Iterator interface.

Redefine methods so that:

a) The first class deduced the value of the array from the first to the last.

Replace the odd elements with zero and display this array.

b) The second class was derived from the last to the first value in one digit.

- Create an anonymous class that should: run from the last to the first element of the array.

Check every third element of the array from the last one or it is odd, if so then display these items on the console.

- Create a Local Class that should: go from the first to the last element of the array,

check every fifth element of the array, if it is even then subtract the number 100 from it, and display these numbers on the console.

- Create a static class that should: go from the first to the last element of the array.

Check every second element of the array for parity, if it is even, then make it odd and display these items on the console.
